# Sales Performing Cleaning 1
This project involves cleaning sales dataset.

## Files:
- 'sales_dataset.xlsx' : Raw dataset
- 'cleaned_sales_dataset.xlsx' : Cleaned dataset


### Cleaning Steps (Power Query):
I cleaned this dataset in **Power Query**:
1. Loaded the source data into Power Query.
2. Transposed rows and columns to correct the layout.
3. Promoted the first rows to headers.
4. Set proper data types (text, number, date).
5. Filled down missing values in repeating fields.
6. Unpivoted other columns to get a tidy/long format.
7. Split a combined field into separate columns by delimiter.
8. Split another field by a second delimiter.
9. Re-applied correct data types to new columns.
10. Removed unnecessary columns before final load.


**Loaded the cleaned table back to Excel for use.**
